Project Description:

This project aims to perform customer segmentation and gain insights into customer behavior using data from a shopping mall. Customer segmentation is a valuable strategy for businesses to understand their customer base better, tailor marketing efforts, and improve overall customer satisfaction. The project involves several key steps, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and clustering.

Project Workflow:

1. Importing Modules: The project begins by importing necessary Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and warnings. These libraries will be used for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.

2. Loading the Dataset: The dataset, named 'Mall_Customers.csv,' is loaded using Pandas. It contains information about mall customers, including customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. Key EDA tasks include:

Displaying the first few rows of the dataset to inspect its structure.
Computing and visualizing the statistical summary of numeric columns (mean, standard deviation, quartiles).
Checking the data types and ensuring there are no missing values in the dataset.
4. Data Visualization: Data distribution plots are created for the following columns:

Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)
These visualizations provide insights into the distribution of customer attributes.

5. Correlation Matrix: A correlation matrix is generated to analyze the relationships between numeric variables in the dataset. The heatmap visualization helps identify any significant correlations.

6. Clustering: Customer segmentation is performed using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Two clustering scenarios are explored:

Cluster on the 'Annual Income (k$)' and 'Spending Score (1-100)' features: The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method. A K-Means model is trained, and customers are assigned to clusters based on their annual income and spending score.
Cluster on the 'Annual Income (k$)', 'Spending Score (1-100)', and 'Age' features: Similar to the previous step, the optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method. A 3D scatter plot is created to visualize customer clusters in three dimensions.
7. Visualization of Clusters: Visualizations are generated to showcase the segmented customer clusters. These visualizations help businesses understand the characteristics of each customer group.

Conclusion:

This project provides valuable insights into customer segmentation and behavior analysis based on mall customer data. By clustering customers into different groups, businesses can tailor marketing strategies and services to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment. Moreover, understanding the correlation between customer attributes can guide decision-making processes, such as product offerings and promotional campaigns.

Next Steps:

Future work on this project could involve:

Evaluating the effectiveness of different clustering algorithms to determine the best model for customer segmentation.
Conducting further analysis within each customer segment to identify key trends and preferences.
Implementing targeted marketing strategies and measuring their impact on customer engagement and sales.
Exploring additional data sources or features to enhance the clustering and analysis results.
